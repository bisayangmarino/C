Learning output

I created this repository to supplement my understanding of C language in order to aid me in my CS50x curriculum. Week 5 PSet problem is WIP. I find it helpful to revisit what I have learned so far from the course and such, consolidate my knowledge.

For anyone with the same interest in learning, feel free to contact me so we can share ideas. Thank you.
